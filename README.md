# EmployeeManager

## Description

This is a JS CLI that demonstrates my ability with JS CLIs and mysql databases. The CLI maintains an employee, role, and department database using prompts and displayed tables.

## Installation

This JS CLI uses Inquirer for prompts and mysql for setting up mysql databses, and console.table to create a cleaner table.

These can be installed using the "npm i" command from the command line while within the directory as there is a package.json to facilitate acquiring each module.

## Usage

This app creates an easy to use database where the user is able to use and interlink 3 separate tables to maintain an employee, role, and departments. By following prompts, the user is able to add, update, and view data from a combination of these 3 tables.
